# budgettracker

<!-- 1. Thank you for using my budget planner app, BudgetBuddy. BudgetBuddy allows you to track your income and expense, and recieve a summary of your activity

2. The description box provided allows you to add descriptions to your income and expsnes, so if you input "$2000" for your paycheck (income) and "$300" for groceries (expense), you should put " paycheck and grocery". If you only entered one or the other, the function works just the same!

3. The "Add data" button submits whatever data you want it to! if youd like to include only an expense, only an income, or both, the "Add Data" button will allow you to do store your data all the same. This makes our app appear cleaner, and more responsive! Try it out! -->

Directions:

1. Add income, expense, or both.
2. Make sure to attach descrption, or you will recieve an error message to do so.
3. No need to type "$" or "," for income or expenses, app only accepts numerical values for those inputs.
   4.Description box and submit data button are valid for both income, and expense. Whatever data is inserted will be added to the table, and properly calculated below.
4. You are NOT required to add both an expense and income at the same time, but app does allow you to do so if desired.
5. To reset budget tracker, refresh the page.
6. Inputs and expenses with the same description will be stored in the same table row, even if submitted seperatley/ at different times.
7. when adding an amount with a description that already exist for that amount, it will replace value already submitted. for example, if you input "300" for "groceries", and later input "200" for "groceries", the "300" will be replaced by the "200".
