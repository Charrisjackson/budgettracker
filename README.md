3. No need to type "$" or "," for income or expenses, app only accepts numerical values for those inputs.
   4.Description box and submit data button are valid for both income, and expense. Whatever data is inserted will be added to the table, and properly calculated below.
4. You are NOT required to add both an expense and income at the same time, but app does allow you to do so if desired.
